#Vapor - LÖVE Distribution Client

![Screenshot](dev/screenshots/screenshot.png)

## Requirements

* LÖVE 0.8.0
* A stable internet connection.

## How can I add my game?

* Fork [this repo](https://github.com/josefnpat/vapor).
* Extend the `games.json` with the following data;

    **Make an [issue](https://github.com/josefnpat/vapor/issues) with all the following information from this step if you can't use git or json.**

Please see [/src/games.json](/src/games.json) for an example of how this is done.

    * id:          A unique id using only A-Z, a-z, underscores and dashes.
    * name:        The name of your game.
    * sources:     An array of links to your .love files with an index representing the current unix timestamp.
                   Please ensure that your game is hosted on an http server as opposed to https.
                   If you can, please host this on a server, as opposed to a shared website like dropbox.
                   @jpikl has found out that you can link to bitbucket http addresses as well! The trick is to use the
                   cdn.bitbucket.org subdomain. See the `src/games.json` for an example.
                   Contact me if you would like me to host your .love file.
    * hashes:      An array of SHA-1 hashes for your .love files with an index representing the current unix timestamp.
                   This means that if you change your .love file on your server, it will no longer be valid, and you will
                   have to make a new entry in the sources and hashes arrays. [1]
    * sizes:       An array of the sizes in bytes for your .love files with an index representing the current unix timestamp.
    * stable:      The timestamp of the current stable release index from your sources list.
                   If you only have one element in sources, this would be that elements index.
    * author:      Your name or handle.
    * website:     Your website. [optional]
    * description: A description of the game. [optional]
    * engine:      The engine that your game runs. Currently only supports `love-0.8.0`.
    * image:       A link to a PNG image 436x245 in dimension. The less text, the better.
                   Please ensure that your image is hosted on an http server as opposed to https.
                   Do not host this on a site that does not allow hotlinking.
                   Sites like imgur.com should do well, but again, private hosts are best.

* Submit your pull request.
* Sit back and bask in the glory.
